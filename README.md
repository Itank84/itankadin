# Welcome to the Tankadin repository!

This is a supplement to [Tankadin](https://wago.io/tankadin), a WeakAuras made for protection Paladins in World of Warcraft TBCC and WotLKC.

You need to extract CustomSounds.zip to your "World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface" directory<br />
Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\CustomSounds\rf.mp3"

When adding a new file, or changing the name or file location of the file, you must exit the game entirely, or the new file won't be recognized!

WoW's folder structure includes separate folders for each game version - _retail_, _classic_, etc. Be sure you're using the correct folder for your game version.
