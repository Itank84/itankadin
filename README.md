# Welcome to the Tankadin wiki!

#### Introduction
I initially corrected the Shear values in [Tankadin II](https://wago.io/dlM3-FUJ-) which was one of numberous Tankadin versions. It was intended for personal use only, but I soon adopted my own version of the [Tankadin WA](https://wago.io/LxgxT9RDn). The aim of my project was and still is to ensure that Tankadin provides accurate information based on solid theorycrafting. Tankadin is an ever-evolving project and it has come a long way since I first started working on it. Tankadin aims to be the most up to date and accurate Tankadin weakaura available.

#### Github files
This weakaura has audio cues to warn users about missing buffs and I have made custom sound files using [Voicemaker](https://voicemaker.in/) to make sure the audio cues are easy to interpret. To take full advantages of this weakaura users are required to supplement it with these audio files.
