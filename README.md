Step 3. Extract CustomSounds.zip file into your interface folder [^1].<br />

[^1]: You need to extract CustomSounds.zip to your "World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface" directory<br />Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\CustomSounds\rf.mp3"<br />WoW's folder structure includes separate folders for each game version - _retail_, _classic_, etc. Be sure you're using the correct folder for your game version.
[^2]: You must exit the game entirely, or the new file won't be recognized!
